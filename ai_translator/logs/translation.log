 Test Data
This dataset contains two test samples provided by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI.
These samples include a markdown table and an English text passage, which can be used to test an
English-to-Chinese translation software supporting both text and table formats.
Text testing
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the English
alphabet at least once. Pangrams are often used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related
tools. In addition to English, there are pangrams in many other languages. Some pangrams are more
difficult to construct due to the unique characteristics of the language.
